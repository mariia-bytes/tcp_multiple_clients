# TCP Multiple Clients

This project implements a TCP client-server relationship, with the ability to support multiple clients connecting to a single server. It is currently in the early stages of development, with the server-side functionality already implemented.

## Current Features

- **Server-Side Implementation**: The server is capable of handling multiple client connections.
- **Client Testing**: The project is still under development, and currently only the server-side functionality is available.

## How to Test

To test the server, you can use either of the following:

1. **Telnet**: You can use Telnet to connect to the server and interact with it.
2. **`tcp_echo_server` Project Client**: You can also use the client from the [tcp_echo_server](https://github.com/mariia-bytes/tcp_echo_server) project to test the server's functionality.

## Next Steps

The next step(s) for this project include:

- Implementing the client-side functionality.

## Installation

This abstact'll be updated once the client side's ready
